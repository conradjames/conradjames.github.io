    <h2> An Ode to Code</h2>
    <p>compiled, arranged and organised by Conrad James Loney</p>
    <p>Stuff that is in here - <b>very important stuff</b> - <em>for everyone</em></p>
    <p>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?<br/>I feel this is a challenging learning curve where you really are thrown in the deep end. I do believe, from what I have seen and heard, that there is a strong desire within both organisations to create a learning environment that encourages us (as budding coders) to learn both as a team and as an individual.</p>
    <p>What are your impressions?<br/>From the video I think it will be important to build a working dialogue within the cohort. People as a group or team can accomplish more and work with greater efficiency when communication between the differing functioning bodies is high. I believe this to be true in most cases but I am worried about my own ability to stay open to group communication because I often shy away from group discussions and are prone to trying to figure stuff out on my own.</p>
    <p>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br/>I believe strongly in the ethos and I love the focus on empathitic learning. I also love to play team sports becasue you are a group working simultaneosly towards achieving a goal. Each member has a part to play and a different role for which they are responsible and in this I love it when you can utilise the strengths of each individual.</p>
    <p>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?<br/>Not particularly, I did think phase 0 would have more class time and something similar to lectures. But i think in general I really didn't know what to expect.</p>
    <p>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br/>I am generally quite a nervous person although I think I hide it well. The environment I think is fascinating casual space having never been in something similar before.</p>
